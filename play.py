            - There is a dice roll to determine who wins each blocking engagement.
            - If any of the defensive linemen wins, there is a dice roll to determine which winning lineman are in position to make a tackle (high chance).
            - There is a dice roll for each lineman in position to see if they tackle the RB.
            - If the RB wins the engagement(s), they advance to the second level phase.
            - If the RB loses any engagement(s), the play is over.
        2. second level phase: RB advances past the line of scrimmage and is now engaging with linebackers and cornerbacks.
            - There is a dice roll to see which linebacker(s) (medium chance) and cornerbacks (low chance) are in the correct position to make a tackle.
            - For linebackers in position, there is a dice roll to see if they make the tackle.
            - If the RB wins the engagement(s), they advance to the open field phase.
        3. open field phase: RB is in the open field and is now engaging with safeties.
            - There is a dice roll to see which safeties are in the correct position to make a tackle (medium chance).
            - For safeties in position, there is a dice roll to see if they make the tackle.
            - If the RB wins the engagement(s), they advance the ball to the end zone.
        If the RB is tackled at any point, yards gained are calculated and the play is over.
        Yards gained for the backfield and second level phase are weighted on a bell curve distribution.
        Yards gained for the open field phase are distributed on a very long tail distribution such that very few open field pays will result in huge gains.
        Yards gained are calculated based on the phase of the play in which the tackle occurred and the rules can be found in the table below:
        Phase	        Yards Gained    Weighting
        Backfield	    -3 to 3         Bell Curve
